    "# Bootstraping procedure in pricing Credit Default swaps\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial instruments used to transfer credit risk from one party to another. They function as insurance contracts on the creditworthiness of a reference entity, such as a corporation or a sovereign nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately price a CDS, the key objective is to determine the implied default probabilities of the reference entity over various maturities, which is where the bootstrapping procedure comes into play. Bootstrapping is a method used to extract these implied survival probabilities from a set of market-quoted CDS spreads with different maturities. \n",
    "## Credit Default Swaps\n",
    "A CDS is a financial derivative that allows an investor to swap or offset their credit risk with that of another\n",
    "investor. The lender buys a CDS from another investor who agrees to reimburse the first if the borrower defaults.\n",
    "CDS are maintained via an ongoing premium payment similar to an insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example : Suppose a company issues a $100 bond of maturity 10 years with regular interest payments\n",
    "throughout the bond’s life. Because the debt issuer cannot guarantee his ability to pay premiums the debt\n",
    "buyer can purchase a CDS to transfer this risk to another investor, who agrees to pay them in the event the\n",
    "debt issuer defaults on its obligation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the most of debts tend to have long maturities the buyer of the CDS pays a the seller until the contract’s\n",
    "maturity. In return the CDS seller agrees that it will pay the CDS buyer the security’s value as well as all\n",
    "interest payments that would have been paid between that time and the maturity date if their is a credit\n",
    "event with a recovery rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDS are triggered with what we call a credit event which are agreed upon when the CDS is purchased\n",
    "and are mentioned in the contract.\\\n",
    "The CDS can be used for multiple reasons : \n",
    "1. Speculating.\n",
    "2. Hedging.\n",
    "3. Arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bootstrape \n",
    "In finance, bootstrapping is a method used to construct a complete yield curve or credit curve from a set of market data points, such as bond prices, interest rates, or CDS spreads. The core idea is to iteratively derive zero-coupon rates, discount factors, or survival probabilities from quoted data to build a curve that spans a range of maturities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s named “bootstrapping” because each new point on the curve is built sequentially, using information from previously derived points—similar to \"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps.\"\n",
    "## Bootstraping in Pricing Credit default swaps\n",
    "In the context of CDS pricing, bootstrapping is used to derive the credit curve or the survival probability curve from CDS spreads. Here’s how the process works:\n",
    "1. Step 1: Gather Market Data: Collect the CDS spreads for different maturities (e.g., 1-year, 3-year, 5-year CDS spreads).\n",
    "2. Step 2: Compute the Premium Leg and Default Leg: For each CDS maturity, calculate the present value of the premium leg (the periodic payments made by the CDS buyer) and the default leg (the expected payment made by the CDS seller if a credit event occurs).\n",
    "3. Step 3: Solve for the Survival Probability: Use an iterative procedure to determine the implied survival probabilities that equate the present value of the premium leg to the present value of the default leg. This is done by solving for the hazard rate ℎ that satisfies the equation:\n",
    "$$\\text{Premium Leg} = \\text{Default leg }$$\n",
    "4. Step 4: Build the Survival Probability Curve: Repeat the procedure for all maturities to construct the entire survival probability curve. The curve captures the probability that the reference entity will not default by each point in time.\n",
