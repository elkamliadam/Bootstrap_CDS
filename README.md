# Bootstraping Procedure in Pricing Credit default swaps
Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial instruments used to transfer credit risk from one party to another. They function as insurance contracts on the creditworthiness of a reference entity, such as a corporation or a sovereign nation.

To accurately price a CDS, the key objective is to determine the implied default probabilities of the reference entity over various maturities, which is where the bootstrapping procedure comes into play. Bootstrapping is a method used to extract these implied survival probabilities from a set of market-quoted CDS spreads with different maturities.
